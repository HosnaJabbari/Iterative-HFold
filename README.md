# HFold Iterative

#### Description:
Software implementation of Iterative HFold.      
Iterative HFold is an algorithm for predicting the pseudoknotted secondary structures of RNA using relaxed Hierarchical Folding. 

Paper: Jabbari, H., Condon, A. A fast and robust iterative algorithm for prediction of RNA pseudoknotted secondary structures. BMC Bioinformatics 15, 147 (2014). https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-15-147 (https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-15-147)

On the dataset tested in this paper, Iterative HFold generally has better accuracy that its predecessor, [HFold](https://github.com/HosnaJabbari/HFold).

#### Supported OS: 
Linux, macOS

### Conda Package:
```
conda install -c uvic-cobra iterative-hfold
```
Works for Linux and macOS

### Source code Installation:  
Requirements: A compiler that supports C++11 standard (tested with g++ version 4.9.0 or higher), Pthreads, and CMake version 3.1 or greater.    

[CMake](https://cmake.org/install/) version 3.1 or greater must be installed in a way that HFold can find it.    
To test if your Mac or Linux system already has CMake, you can type into a terminal:      
```
cmake --version
```
If it does not print a cmake version greater than or equal to 3.1, you will have to install CMake depending on your operating system.

#### Mac:    
Easiest way is to install homebrew and use that to install CMake.    
To do so, run the following from a terminal to install homebrew:      
```  
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"  
```    
When that finishes, run the following from a terminal to install CMake.     
```   
brew install cmake   
``` 
#### Linux:    
Run from a terminal     
```
wget http://www.cmake.org/files/v3.8/cmake-3.8.2.tar.gz
tar xzf cmake-3.8.2.tar.gz
cd cmake-3.8.2
./configure
make
make install
```
[Linux instructions source](https://geeksww.com/tutorials/operating_systems/linux/installation/downloading_compiling_and_installing_cmake_on_linux.php)

#### Steps for installation   
1. [Download the repository](https://github.com/HosnaJabbari/HFold_iterative.git) and extract the files onto your system.
2. From a command line in the root directory (where this README.md is) run
```
cmake -H. -Bbuild
cmake --build build
```   
If you need to specify a specific compiler, such as g++, you can instead run something like   
```
cmake -H. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++
cmake --build build
```   
This can be useful if you are getting errors about your compiler not having C++11 features.

After installing you can move the executables wherever you wish, but you should not delete or move the simfold folder, or you must recompile the executables. If you move the folders and wish to recompile, you should first delete the created "build" folder before recompiling.

#### How to use:
    Arguments:
        HFold_iterative:
            -r <structure>
            -i </path/to/file>
            -o </path/to/file>
            -v
            -V
            -n <number of outputs>
            -p

        Remarks:
            make sure the <arguments> are enclosed in "", for example -r "..().." instead of -r ..()..
            The sequence does not need to be enclosed and can be given before or after the other arguments
            if no structure is provided through -r , the input structure will be the hotspot with the lowest free energy
            if -i is provided with just a file name without a path, it is assuming the file is in the diretory where the executable is called
            if -o is provided with just a file name without a path, the output file will be generated in the diretory where the executable is called
            if -v is provided, a verbose output will be given (method used is outputted)
            if -V is provided, the version is given
            if -n is provided with a number, it will modify the number of hotspots looked and outputs given (the base is 1)
            if -p is provided, it will change the output to pseudoknot-free

    
    Sequence requirements:
        containing only characters GCAUT

    Structure requirements:
        -pseudoknot free
        -containing only characters ._(){}[]
        Remarks:
            Restricted structure symbols:
                () restricted base pair
                _ no restriction

    Input file requirements:
            Line1: Name (optional, but must be fasta format; ignored in final input)
            Line2: Sequence (required)
            Line3: Structure (optional)
        sample:
            >Srp_005
            GCAACGAUGACAUACAUCGCUAGUCGACGC
            (____________________________)

#### Example:
    assume you are in the directory where the Iterative-HFold executable is loacted
    ./Iterative-HFold -i "/home/username/Desktop/myinputfile.txt"
    ./Iterative-HFold -i "/home/username/Desktop/myinputfile.txt" -o "outputfile.txt"
    ./Iterative-HFold -i "/home/username/Desktop/myinputfile.txt" -o "/home/username/Desktop/some_folder/outputfile.txt"
    ./Iterative-HFold GCAACGAUGACAUACAUCGCUAGUCGACGC -r "(____________________________)"
    ./Iterative-HFold GCAACGAUGACAUACAUCGCUAGUCGACGC -r "(____________________________)" -o "outputfile.txt"
    ./Iterative-HFold GCAACGAUGACAUACAUCGCUAGUCGACGC
    ./Iterative-HFold GCAACGAUGACAUACAUCGCUAGUCGACGC -n 10
    ./Iterative-HFold GCAACGAUGACAUACAUCGCUAGUCGACGC -p
