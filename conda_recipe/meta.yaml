  summary: "RNA secondary structure prediction with pseudoknots using relaxed Hierarchical Folding."
  description: |
        HFold Iterative is a computational tool for predicting RNA secondary structures, 
        including pseudoknotted configurations, using a relaxed Hierarchical Folding 
        approach. This algorithm iteratively refines predictions to improve accuracy, 
        outperforming its predecessor HFold on tested datasets.

        The software is implemented in C++ and requires a C++11-compatible compiler, 
        Pthreads, and CMake (â‰¥3.1) for installation. It is compatible with Linux and macOS, 
        offering a command-line interface for flexible usage.

        ### Features:
        - Predicts RNA secondary structures, including pseudoknots.
        - Uses an iterative approach for improved accuracy.
        - Supports user-defined structure constraints.
        - Provides options for pseudoknot-free outputs.
